# tensegrity-statics
Implements the equations of static equilibrium of a tensegrity system as Ax=u.  Tensions via an LP.  Plots.

All codes in Matlab syntax.

The main code (tensegrity_statics.m) implements the equations in section 2.1 of:

   Bewley (2019) Stabilization of low-altitude balloon systems, Part 2:
   riggings with multiple taut ground tethers, analyzed as tensegrity systems
   
The plotting code (tensegrity_plot.m) makes some rudimentary 2D or 3D plots, as appropriate.

All figures from the above paper are also included, in addition to a few from
   Skelton and de Oliveira (2009) Tensegrity Systems
   
Please do submit pull requests as you develop more examples!  :)
